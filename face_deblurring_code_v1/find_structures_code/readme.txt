%% gradient_similarity.m is used to compute the similarity values v_i between the blurred gradient and exemplar gradients
(see euqation (3) in our paper)
"compute_similarity.m" is the demo function which does not consider the scale and rotation..

"test_scale_rotation_v2.m" is the demo function which considers the scale and rotation.
